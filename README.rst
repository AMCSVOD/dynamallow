DynamoDB + Marshmallow == Dynamallow
====================================

Two awesome things, better together!

Dynamallow provides integration between the `Boto v3 DynamoDB API`_ and `Marshmallow`_.  Together they provide an ORM
inspired interface to the `DynamoDB`_ service with a fully defined, strongly typed schema.

This package is still very much a work in progress, but has basic working functional tests.
